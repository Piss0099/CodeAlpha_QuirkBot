# QuirkBot - Notes & Challenges

1. Simple TF-IDF without preprocessing gave poor results.
   → I added stopword removal and stemming for better accuracy.

2. Sometimes irrelevant answers came back.
   → I set a similarity threshold (0.3) to avoid wrong matches.

3. FAQs stored in a JSON file for easy customization.
